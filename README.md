# Model View Controller (MVC) Demo

## Introduction
This project is based upon [Sam Halperin's](https://github.com/shalperin) from [JavaScript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/): [Loosely Coupled, Reusable UI Components](http://samhalperin.me/2012/11/02/loosely-coupled-reusable-ui-components-in-backbone-js/). This demo is meant to be an implementation of the concepts presented in the article using [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) (a JavaScript library). The purpose of this implementation is to show how Knockout's *observables* by default create the separation of concerns between the object being acted upon and the logic behind it. Using Knockout is good introduction into using the MVC design pattern.

## Setup
To get this going, download this repository and `cd` into the root folder. Start an HTTP server: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000`. In your browser go to [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000/). If you do not have [Python](http://python.org), simply open `index.html` from your web browser.

You can also see this demo staged here: TBA.
